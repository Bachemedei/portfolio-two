I'm a trained molecular microbiologist who found a love for software development while learning programming for analysing huge amounts of genomic data. I've since pivoted into tech and am currently working as a Test Analyst at Adapptor while undertaking studies on a scholarship position with She Codes Plus. 

Data gets me excited, particularly if it's medical based, but over the last six months I've also discovered a passion for web development. 

I don't think I'll ever want to stop learning and am excited for what I'll learn next. I'm thinking C - got a suggestion? Or maybe you just want to have a chat with me - contact me!
