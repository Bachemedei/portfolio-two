I wrote a Python script which took weather data scraped from the web, and outputted meaningful summaries and visualisations.

Although I had experience writing functions in JavaScript, this project was a good introduction to functions in Python. This project gave me the skills to work with JSON data in python and become comfortable with nested dictionaries and lists. 

I used Plotly to create visualisations including bar and time series, and box plots.
