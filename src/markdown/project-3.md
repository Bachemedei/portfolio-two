To use my newly developed HTML & CSS skills I build a prototype personal portfolio website. 
Key features included responsive design to work on a variety of screen sizes, including mobile, styling using Flexbox, and text summaries on image hover.

The website was deployed using GitHub.

I've since made a new website using ReactJS & Gatsby. You're looking at it right now!
