The first project I undertook using HTML & CSS was to design a personal website. 
I used Flexbox for styling the website and media queries to implement responsive design.

The website was deployed using GitHub.

After learning React, I decided to make a new portfolio using Gatsby. This project helped me to try out my new React skills but also introduced me to using GraphQL to create a data layer in Gatsby. 
The new version of my portfolio website was deployed with Netlify and you're looking at it right now. It's still a work in progress so if you come back in a few days, things may look a bit different!
