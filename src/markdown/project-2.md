In 2019 & 2020, using Node JS, I developed a SlackBot to keep track of mobile test devices. The bot kept track of the device details and location. Users could request to check out a device, which would change the location to being with that user. 

Additional commands the bot responded to included adding a new device, updating the OS version, and adding any notes to a particular device.

The bot was deployed to an EC2 instance on AWS using docker.
