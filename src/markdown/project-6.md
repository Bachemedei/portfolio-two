To prepare myself for learning React, I spent time re-introducing myself with, and expanding my skills in JavaScript. 

I had never manipulated the DOM using JavaScript before, so I started with a few simple exercises. First, I created a web page which displayed a number and had a button to increase, and another to decrease, a counter. Second, a list of items which could be added to a 'shopping cart' and calculated the total cost. 

Once feeling comfortable with using JavaScript to create front-end changes, I made the game whack-a-mole. Initially, it seemed like a bit of a daunting task to I decided to break it down into digestible steps.
* Create 4 containers, each with a button. Pressing the button makes the word "mole" appear
* Remove the buttons and add a single button which causes the word "mole" to appear in one of the containers at random
* Generate two random time, each within a set timeframe - one for the time between mole appearances, and another for the duration which the mole stays on screen
* Create the game loop
* Register clicks the user makes while a mole is on screen and determine if the click hit the target
* Display the current score and a high score
* Swap the word "mole" for a picture of an actual mole and do some styling
* Play!

I followed up whack-a-mole with two more games - Rock Paper Scissors, and a true classic - Snake. With both of these games, I took a similar incremental approach.

After spending some time learning React, I decided to rewrite whack-a-mole in ReactJS and made it better than ever.
