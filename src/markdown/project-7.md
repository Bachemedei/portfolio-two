One of my favourite projects I've worked on to-date has been creating a prototype of a crowdfunding platform for supporting animal rescue organisations with adoption costs.
Planning included writing an MVP, designing API specifications, a database schema, and creating wireframes using Figma.  

The backend was developed using Django Rest Framework and included a custom user model with email log in, several user types with various permissions and signals for linking user models with profiles.  

The frontend was developed with ReactJS, using functional components and hooks. Highlights of the front end app includes, animal logos as multi-select categories, pop up modals for confirmations, tool tips, form validation errors, progress bars.
Custom private routes ensured that only users with the correct permissions were able to access, create, and edit items.
