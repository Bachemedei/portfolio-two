To familiarise myself with the Python Django Framework, I created a dummy news website.

Highlights of the website includes a custom user model, flash messages on account creation and deletion of news stories, personal profiles and author profiles.

Skills I developed while working on this project included learning OOP, working with the Django Framework and Authorisation.
