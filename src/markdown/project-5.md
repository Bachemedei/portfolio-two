While learning Django, I created a dummy news website - a homage to the OG Django developers. 

Creating this website helped me understand how relational databases can be used for efficient web development. An aspect I really enjoy is using primary keys to link models, and how those methods can be used to dynamically populate the webpage. The "ah-ha moment" was discovering how simple it was to show all the stories (from the "Stories Model") when a logged in user clicks their profile link. 

This project also gave me a better understanding of object oriented programming
